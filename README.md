# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey, I'm **Damien**, better known as **DamiOderSowas** on GitHub.

I'm a developer focused on building **Minecraft network infrastructure, backend systems and developer-oriented software**.

I'm also the **Founder & CEO of JustSimpleNetworks**, an open-source organization focused on creating modular infrastructure for modern Minecraft networks.

My goal is simple:

> **Build systems once, design them properly, and make them reusable.**

---

# 🏢 JustSimpleNetworks

I'm currently building **JustSimpleNetworks** as a modular ecosystem for Minecraft networks.

Instead of creating one massive plugin that does everything, the organization focuses on independent projects that communicate through shared APIs and infrastructure.

# 🚀 What I'm Building

My current focus is the **NetworkCore ecosystem**.

### 🧠 NetworkCore

The central infrastructure layer for the entire network.

It provides shared systems for:

* Database access
* Redis communication
* Player services
* Server discovery
* Server status
* Messaging
* Events
* Configuration
* Permissions
* Settings
* Plugin registration
* API versioning

```text
Network Plugin
       │
       ▼
 NetworkCore API
       │
 ┌─────┼──────┬──────────┐
 ▼     ▼      ▼          ▼
 DB   Redis  Players    Servers
```

The Core is intentionally focused on **infrastructure**, not gameplay.

# 🧩 Network Ecosystem

Projects I'm working on or planning include:

| Project                    | Purpose                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 **NetworkCore**         | Shared network infrastructure            |
| 💰 **NetworkEconomy**      | Network-wide currencies and transactions |
| 👥 **NetworkFriends**      | Friends and social features              |
| 🎉 **NetworkParty**        | Cross-server parties                     |
| 👤 **NetworkProfile**      | Global player profiles                   |
| 🧭 **NetworkNavigator**    | Server selection and navigation          |
| 📊 **NetworkStats**        | Statistics and leaderboards              |
| 💬 **NetworkChat**         | Network-wide communication               |
| 🎨 **NetworkCosmetics**    | Cosmetics and visual systems             |
| 🏆 **NetworkAchievements** | Network achievements                     |
| 🎯 **NetworkQuests**       | Quest and progression systems            |
| 🎁 **NetworkRewards**      | Rewards and daily systems                |
| 🛒 **NetworkShop**         | Network-wide shops                       |
| 📨 **NetworkMail**         | Player mail and notifications            |
| 🖥️ **NetworkServer**      | Server infrastructure and management     |

The ecosystem is designed so that each project has a **clear responsibility** instead of becoming another all-in-one plugin.

# 🏗️ Development Philosophy

I care about more than simply making something work.

Projects should also be:

### 🔌 Modular

Every system should have a clear responsibility.

### 🧩 API-First

Public APIs should be clean, understandable and reusable.

### ⚡ Performant

Blocking database operations and unnecessary network traffic should be avoided.

### 🔐 Secure

Infrastructure should consider authentication, validation, replay protection, race conditions and data integrity.

### 📈 Scalable

The architecture should be able to grow with the network.

### 📚 Maintainable

Code should still make sense months or years after it was written.

# 🛠️ Current Focus

                         ▼
                  JustSimpleNetworks
```

I'm currently focused on building the foundation first.

That means:

* Stable APIs
* Service architecture
* Database infrastructure
* Redis communication
* Player services
* Server services
* Events
* Configuration
* Plugin dependencies
* Cross-server communication

The specialized systems come on top of that foundation.

---

# 📊 My Approach

I prefer building systems like this:

### ❌ Not this

```text
Plugin
├── Database
├── Redis
├── Player Cache
├── Server Registry
├── Messaging
├── Permissions
└── Everything else
```

### ✅ But this

```text
                 NetworkCore
                      │
       ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
       ▼              ▼              ▼
   Database         Redis         Services
       │              │              │
       └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                      │
                      ▼
                Network Plugins
                      │
       ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
       ▼              ▼              ▼
    Economy        Friends         Party
```

**Infrastructure belongs in the infrastructure layer.**

---

# 🌱 Open Source

JustSimpleNetworks is intended to be an **open-source ecosystem**.

I want developers to be able to:

* Read the source
* Understand the architecture
* Use the APIs
* Build their own integrations
* Contribute improvements
* Extend existing systems

Good infrastructure shouldn't be locked away behind unnecessary complexity.

---

# 🎯 Long-Term Vision

The long-term goal is to build a Minecraft network ecosystem that can grow without constantly replacing its infrastructure.

```text
1 Server
   │
   ▼
10 Servers
   │
   ▼
50 Servers
   │
   ▼
100+ Servers
```

The architecture should scale with the network.

New servers should be able to join.

Old servers should be removable.

Plugins should be replaceable.

APIs should remain stable.

And the infrastructure should continue working underneath it all.

---

# 📌 Philosophy

> **Build the infrastructure once.
> Build everything else on top of it.**

That's the idea behind **JustSimpleNetworks**.

And that's what I'm building.
